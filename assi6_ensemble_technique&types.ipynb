    "Step 1: Initialize the Model\n",
    "Start by selecting a weak learner, usually a simple model like a small decision tree \n",
    "(also known as a stump).\n",
    "The model is trained on the original training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Make Predictions\n",
    "The first weak learner makes predictions on the training data. Since it’s a simple \n",
    "model, it might not perform very well and will likely make some errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate Errors\n",
    "Identify the instances in the training data where the model made incorrect \n",
    "predictions. Boosting focuses on these errors to improve future models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Adjust Weights\n",
    "Increase the weights of the misclassified instances. This means that in the \n",
    "next iteration, the model will pay more attention to these difficult cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Train the Next Model\n",
    "Train a new weak learner on the adjusted dataset, where the misclassified\n",
    "instances are given more importance.\n",
    "This new model tries to correct the mistakes made by the previous model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Repeat the Process\n",
    "Repeat the process of making predictions, calculating errors, adjusting weights, \n",
    "and training new models. This continues for a predefined number of iterations or \n",
    "until the model achieves satisfactory performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Combine Models\n",
    "The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the weak learners.\n",
    "This is usually done by a weighted sum of their outputs, where better-performing\n",
    "models have a higher influence on the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 8: Final Output\n",
    "The final model, which is a combination of all the weak learners, should now be\n",
    "much more accurate than any individual model alone. This ensemble model is\n",
    "what we refer to as the boosted model."
